Assignment 1: MiNeFiElD

MiNeFiElD is a very simple game, where the player controls a tank via the arrow keys. The idea is to get to the top of the map having avoided the moving mines to gain a point. Each time a point is gained the mines on the screen move faster and as a result the difficulty is increased. The player has at least two minutes to acquire as many points as possible during their gameplay run.d
